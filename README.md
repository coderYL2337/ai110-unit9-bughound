# 🐶 BugHound

BugHound is a small, agent-style debugging tool. It analyzes a Python code snippet, proposes a fix, and runs basic reliability checks before deciding whether the fix is safe to apply automatically.

## What BugHound Does

Given a short Python snippet, BugHound:

1. **Analyzes** the code for potential issues  
   - Uses heuristics in offline mode  
   - Uses Gemini when API access is enabled  

2. **Proposes a fix**  
   - Either heuristic-based or LLM-generated  
   - Attempts minimal, behavior-preserving changes  

3. **Assesses risk**  
   - Scores the fix  
   - Flags high-risk changes  
   - Decides whether the fix should be auto-applied or reviewed by a human  

4. **Shows its work**  
   - Displays detected issues  
   - Shows a diff between original and fixed code  
   - Logs each agent step

## Setup

### 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running in Offline (Heuristic) Mode

No API key required.

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Heuristic only (no API)

This mode uses simple pattern-based rules and is useful for testing the workflow without network access.

---

## Running with Gemini

### 1. Set up your API key

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

### 2. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Gemini (requires API key)
* Choose a Gemini model and temperature

BugHound will now use Gemini for analysis and fix generation, while still applying local reliability checks.

---

## Running Tests

Tests focus on **reliability logic** and **agent behavior**, not the UI.

```bash
pytest
```

You should see tests covering:

* Risk scoring and guardrails
* Heuristic fallbacks when LLM output is invalid
* End-to-end agent workflow shape

---

## Summary

The core concept in this unit is understanding that LLM output is untrusted by default and must be validated before acting on it — the agent needs parsing, normalization, and compile-checks as guardrails between the model and any automated action. Students are most likely to struggle with the gap between the heuristic and Gemini paths: when the LLM is available, heuristic checks were originally skipped entirely, which meant reliable detections (like syntax errors via `compile()`) silently disappeared. AI was helpful for generating context-aware fixes and detecting nuanced issues that pattern matching cannot catch, but it was misleading when it returned empty results or echoed back broken code — the agent trusted it without verification. When guiding a stuck student,I would ask: "What happens to your `compile()` check when `_can_call_llm()` returns True?" — prompting them to trace the control flow and discover that the heuristic path is skipped, without directly revealing the merge-based solution.
